# ProgramTracker
Used for tracking how long certain programs are used for.

When you close the program, it will hide it in the toolbar instead of actually closing the program. (It is meant to be run in the background.) You can exit the program by right clicking the icon in the toolbar and selecting 'Exit'. You can either click the 3 dots on the right of the process or right click it to open a menu.
There aren't any editing capabilities on the time entries yet, but that will eventually be added.

If you have issues with some processes not detecting when they close or not getting the icons, run the program as administrator.

This needs to be built as a 64-bit program, otherwise it isn't able to get information about 64-bit processes.
